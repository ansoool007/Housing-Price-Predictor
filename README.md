# Housing Price Prediction Model

## Overview
This project involves building a **Housing Price Prediction Model** using the Bengaluru Housing Price Dataset from Kaggle. The goal was to predict house prices accurately by performing data cleaning, feature engineering, and outlier detection. Various models were tested, and **cross-validation** was used to select the best-performing model.

## Introduction
Accurate house price prediction is valuable for buyers, sellers, and real estate agencies alike. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to build a reliable housing price model, leveraging feature engineering and model optimization to achieve accurate predictions.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Bengaluru Housing Price Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
- **Type**: Regression task to predict housing prices.
- **Features**: A range of features including the size, location, number of bedrooms, and other key attributes that impact housing prices.

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a crucial step in building an accurate prediction model. The following steps were implemented:
- **Data Cleaning**: Removed missing values, handled duplicates, and corrected inconsistencies in the dataset.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracted relevant features and created new ones to better capture the factors impacting house prices.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identified and removed outliers to prevent them from skewing the modelâ€™s predictions.

## Model Training
To select the best model for housing price prediction, the following steps were performed:
- **Model Selection**: Tested multiple machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, and random forests.
- **Cross-Validation**: Implemented cross-validation to evaluate model performance and ensure generalizability. This helped in selecting the most suitable model based on various performance metrics.

### Key Techniques:
- **Cross-Validation**: Used to assess model stability and avoid overfitting.
- **Feature Scaling**: Applied normalization or standardization to features where necessary.
